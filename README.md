## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get your own instance of the Mistral API up and running.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You will also need an API key from [https://api.aimlapi.com](https://api.aimlapi.com).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MasterShayan/Mistral-API.git
    cd Mistral-API
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install flask requests
    ```

3.  **Set your API Key:**

    Open the `app.py` file and replace the placeholder API key with your actual API key from [https://api.aimlapi.com](https://api.aimlapi.com) in this line:

    ```python
    api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" # Replace with your actual API key
    ```

    **Important:**  For security in production environments, consider using environment variables to manage your API key instead of hardcoding it directly in the script.

4.  **Run the Flask application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or `http://localhost:5000/`.

### Usage

Send a GET request to the `/chat` endpoint with your query as a parameter `q`.

**Example Request:**

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat?q=Hello, how are you today?
```

**Example JSON Response:**

```json
{
    "id": "...",
    "object": "chat.completion",
